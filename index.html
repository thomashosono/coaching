        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I started playing games when I was a kid. I got introduced to PC games early on by my brother and ever since I've been into video games. I did my first ever competition on LAN at 12 years old at the Gamers Assembly located in Poitiers, France. I did my first scene experience at 14 in Paris at the ESWC 2015 and I got my first ever professional contract at 18 on a game called Overwatch when I joined the Toronto Defiant.</p>
